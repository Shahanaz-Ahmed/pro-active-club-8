        <h1>Frequently Ask Question</h1>
        <h3>How does react work?</h3>
        <p>
          ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known as
          components. React components work similarly to JavaScript functions as
          they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props.Itâ€™s possible
          to have as many components as necessary without cluttering your code.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Differnece between props and state?</h3>
        <p>
          Props are read only.Props can not be modified.On the other hand state
          changes can be asynchronous.state can be modified using this.setState
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What does useEffect do?</h3>
        <p>
          Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state
          variable (or any props) right from the effect.Hooks embrace JavaScript
          closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript
          already provides a solution.useEffect run after every render by
          default.
